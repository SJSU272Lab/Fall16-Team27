# Fall16-Team27


Project Abstract

Together

Current Scenario:

Ever wonder why large sports teams outperform small ones? Aren't all atheletes equal? The answer lies in Performance Analysis and smart training.

Big Sports clubs are able to have their own sports analyst teams who personally train each athelete, send them on a strict diet and monitor their physical activity. This requires a lot of financial investment and infrastructure.

Small teams cannot afford this.

Proposed Scenario:

Using Fitness IOT devices such as Jawbone, Garmin Vivofit, FitBit etc, a small team can have their own Smart Training management system to store, analyse and visualize the fitness activity data of their players with a minimal investment of just the IOT device cost.

This web based system can allow coaches to explore player's activity and with enough data they can have their own Analytics dashboards using opensource technologies like R and Shiny to build smart dashboards for team management.

This can also be possibly extended with a mobile app to allow the coaches to monitor the progress on the go
